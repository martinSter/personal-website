A new paper from our group is now available as a preprint (see below). In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches to epidemic source detection and identify key limitations in existing methods. In addition, we introduce our own principled GNN architecture and demonstrate promising empirical results.

The preprint is available on arXiv:
