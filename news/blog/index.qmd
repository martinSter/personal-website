I'm excited to announce that I've started a blog right here on this website ([see here](../blog/index.qmd)). I know the internet is already overflowing with blogs and other content, and the world certainly wasnâ€™t waiting for yet another person eager to share their thoughts.

But honestly, this blog is, above all, a creative outlet for me. Writing my first post was a lot of fun, and if others find it interestingâ€”great! If not, no hard feelings. ðŸ˜‰

That said, this first post took a surprising amount of effort (a full workday, if weâ€™re being honestâ€”don't tell my boss). So, I wonâ€™t be posting on a fixed schedule. Instead, whenever I have an interesting analysis that isnâ€™t quite enough for a formal publication, a cool data visualization, or a neat tutorial on a model or algorithmâ€”and, crucially, some spare timeâ€”Iâ€™ll share it here.

Speaking of which, my first post explores how to use Swiss public transport data to create a directed network. I plan to turn this into a series of blogposts, applying different network science concepts to that network.
